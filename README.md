# CanvasCommandLine Application (Springer Nature Code Challenge)



## Dependencies

There is no specific library dependency I just used Java8 and Junit for the development. Off course I used maven jar plugin for building jar file and for simplicity I have applied maven wrapper

**Thats it!**


## Design decisions

## How to run

You're given the task of writing a simple console version of a drawing program. The functionality of the program is quite limited but should be extensible. The program should work as follows:

1. after cloning got to app directory and run ./mvnw install. this command will generate jar file after all test cases passed.
2. cd target  (go to target folder)
3. run this command java -jar CoavasCommandLineApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and there we go!
