# CanvasCommandLine Application (Springer Nature Code Challenge)

This a sample application for exposing my programming and design skills, I hope it works.


## Dependencies

There is no specific library dependency I just used Java8 and Junit for the development. I used maven jar plugin for building jar file and for simplicity I have applied maven wrapper

**Thats it!**


## Design decisions

## Interfaces : 
    Command interface : draw (for upating canvas elements)
    Canvas  interface : display Canvas, keep commands
    Shape   interface : draw shape using Canvas
    
## Concrete Classes :  
    Command conceret classes :CreateCanvasCommandImpl,DrawLineCommandImpl,DrawRectangleCommandImpl,BucketFillCommandImpl,
    QuiteCanvasCommandImpl class names are self-explatory
    Canvas concrete classes : CanvasImpl
    Shape concrete classes : Shape and Line
    CanvasCommandFactory   : for processing command line and creating related comand class
    
## How to run

You need to do following steps for runing the project via command line :

1. after cloning got to app directory and run ./mvnw install. this command will generate jar file after all test cases passed.
2. cd target  (go to target folder)
3. run this command java -jar CoavasCommandLineApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and there we go!


 
## Sample I/O

**Application is case sensitive and all Command letters should be UpperCase !**

The program should support the following commands:
   
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `C w h`     | Should create a new canvas of width w and height h. |
| `L x1 y1 x2 y2` | Should create a new line from `(x1,y1)` to `(x2,y2)`. Currently only horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the `x` character. |
| `R x1 y1 x2 y2` | Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is `(x1,y1)` and lower right corner is `(x2,y2)`. Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn using the `x` character. |
| `B x y c` | Should fill the entire area connected to `(x,y)` with colour `'c'`. The behaviour of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint programs. |
| `Q` | Should quit the program. |
